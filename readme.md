# taskmonger

This is a terminal application I made for managing tasks. I like the charm of using terminal applications, and I found out that you can use ink to write react applications in the terminal! It's actually awesome and makes it so much easier and more fun to make tools in the terminal.

Future plans:

- make a CLI to enable adding, completing, modifying (etc) tasks from the command line, without needing to actually use this application's UI. Would enable external scripting, and allow you to "jot down" simple tasks from the command line.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install --global taskmonger
```

## Usage

To use, simply enter `taskmonger` in your terminal to launch the application. You can enter Escape at any time to leave the application.
